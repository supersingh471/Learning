# Learning MERN Stack

Just my practice code and projects while learning web development.

## What's in here

Right now I'm working on:
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- TypeScript basics
- Creating and reading data from database

This repo will have more stuff as I keep learning - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Nextjs and whatever else comes up.

## Why I'm doing this

Learning full-stack development to build actual projects. Want to get good at databases, authentication, and making things that work.


Work in progress. Will update as I learn more.
